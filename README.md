# Business_Card
The basic foundation was a follow-along tutorial of learning Flutter development from the London App Brewery. I also added functionality by adding buttons to contact info and different color and icons to make it more of visually pleasing. The code that mostly comes from this project are fully created by London App Brewery with all respect except for Button Functionality, color, and icons/fonts. This is a way to show that I am in the process of learning Flutter and Dart.
